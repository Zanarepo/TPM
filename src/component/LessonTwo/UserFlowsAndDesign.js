        <p className="text-lg mt-4 text-gray-600">
          User Flows describe the steps a user takes to accomplish a task within your product. They illustrate how users navigate through different screens and interact with features. Wireframes are low-fidelity mockups of the UI that outline the basic layout and functionality of each screen in the product.

            <FiCheckCircle className="mr-3 text-blue-600" />
            <strong>Clear Requirements:</strong> Wireframes ensure that engineers and designers are aligned on what needs to be built before moving into detailed design or development.

          <li className="flex items-center">
            <FiEdit className="mr-3 text-blue-600" />
            <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Clear user flows and wireframes help you work closely with designers to ensure that product features are easy to understand and use.

          <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
            A user flow for the “Sign-up” process might include the following steps:
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-gray-600">
              <li>User enters email</li>
              <li>User creates a password</li>
              <li>User verifies email</li>
            </ul>
            Wireframes for these steps would lay out where the email field, password field, and call-to-action buttons appear on the page.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          Interaction Design (IxD) focuses on designing how users interact with a product—what happens when they click a button, hover over a link, or swipe through content. Usability Testing involves testing your product with real users to see how well they can navigate and complete tasks. Feedback gathered from these tests helps you identify pain points and improve the user experience.
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li className="flex items-center">
            <FiArrowRightCircle className="mr-3 text-blue-600" />
            <strong>User-Centered Design:</strong> Interaction design ensures the product’s UI supports how users think and behave, making it easier for users to achieve their goals.
          </li>
          <li className="flex items-center">
            <FiCheckCircle className="mr-3 text-blue-600" />
            <strong>Iterative Improvement:</strong> Usability testing ensures you gather feedback early and often to improve the product, which saves time and money compared to making major changes after the product is launched.

            <FiLayers className="mr-3 text-blue-600" />
            <strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> Usability testing and analytics can help TPMs validate hypotheses and prioritize features based on actual user behavior rather than assumptions.

            <FiMonitor className="mr-3 text-blue-600" />
            <strong>Collaboration and Advocacy:</strong> TPMs can advocate for the user experience during product discussions, ensuring that technical features don’t compromise usability.

          <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
            For a mobile banking app, you might test a new feature that lets users set up recurring payments. You would conduct usability tests to see how easy users find the process. Are they able to set up payments quickly? Do they understand how to set the frequency and amounts? Are there any confusing labels or buttons?

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          For a TPM, understanding Customer Journey Mapping and UX/UI Design is essential in delivering a product that not only meets business goals but also creates positive, impactful user experiences. By leveraging concepts like customer personas, empathy maps, user flows, wireframes, interaction design, and usability testing, you can collaborate more effectively with design teams, optimize features, and ensure that the product aligns with both user expectations and company objectives.
