      <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
        Agile is a flexible and iterative approach to project management that helps teams deliver high-quality products faster and more efficiently. It focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, and small, manageable work increments.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. What is Agile?</h2>
        <p className="text-sm">
          Agile methodology is based on the Agile Manifesto, which focuses on:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
          <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</li>
          <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation.</li>
          <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.</li>
          <li>Responding to change over following a plan.</li>
        </ul>

          <strong>Key Benefits of Agile:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
          <li>Flexibility: Agile allows for changes even late in the development process.</li>
          <li>Faster Delivery: Short, iterative cycles (called sprints) ensure that features are delivered faster.</li>
          <li>Continuous Improvement: Teams regularly reflect on their work to improve processes.</li>

        <p className="text-sm">
          Scrum is an Agile framework that divides the development process into Sprints (short cycles of work), and each Sprint delivers a product increment. 
          <strong>Key Scrum Roles:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
          <li>Product Owner: Defines and prioritizes product features (e.g., user stories).</li>

          <li>Development Team: The team of engineers that builds the product increment.</li>

          <li>Product Backlog: A prioritized list of features, bugs, and improvements.</li>
          <li>Sprint Backlog: A subset of tasks from the product backlog for the current Sprint.</li>
          <li>Increment: The working product that is produced after each Sprint.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          <strong>Scrum Events:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
          <li>Sprint Planning: The team plans what to achieve in the Sprint.</li>

        <p className="text-sm">
          Kanban is an Agile framework that focuses on visualizing the workflow and managing work items through various stages of the process. Itâ€™s a continuous flow system, as opposed to Scrum's iterative sprints.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          <strong>Key Kanban Concepts:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
          <li>Kanban Board: A visual tool where work items are displayed in columns representing the stages of development (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).</li>
          <li>Work In Progress (WIP): Limits the number of tasks in any given stage to avoid bottlenecks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          <strong>Key Benefits of Kanban:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
          <li>Continuous Delivery: Since there are no Sprints, work is delivered continuously.</li>
          <li>Flexibility: Work can be reprioritized as needed.</li>
          <li>Efficient Workflows: Helps prevent overloading the team with too many tasks at once.</li>

          <strong>User Stories:</strong> A user story is a short, simple description of a feature from the perspective of the end user.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">Example: "As a user, I want to log into my account so that I can access my personal dashboard."</p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          <strong>Epics:</strong> An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller user stories. 
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Example: "Account Management" (which could consist of user stories like login, profile editing, password recovery, etc.).
